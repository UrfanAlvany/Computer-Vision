# Computer-Vision
 Consists of implementations of some simple computer vision algorithms like canny-edge detector, k-means clustering, and agglomerative clustering algorithms, along with the use of discrete convolution to modify images, like sharpening images, or taking derivatives in the x or y direction as a step towards implementing canny-edge detector
